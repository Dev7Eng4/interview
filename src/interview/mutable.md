# Mutable and Immutable

- mutable: modifying the copy also modifies the original (reference type:)
- immutable: modifying the copy does not affect the original (primitive type: can't modify them but can reassign them with some new values)

# Primitive type and reference type

- primitive type: the memory is allocated in the stack
- reference type: the memory is allocated in the heap
